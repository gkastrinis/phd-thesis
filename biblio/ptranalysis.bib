  abstract = {
    Higher-order typed languages, such as ML, provide strong
    support for data and type abstraction.  While such abstraction
    is often viewed as costing performance, there are situations
    where it may provide opportunities for more aggressive program
    optimization. Specifically, we can exploit the fact that type
    abstraction guarantees representation independence, which allows
    the compiler to specialize data representations.  This paper
    describes a first step in supporting such optimizations; namely
    a control-flow analysis that uses the program's type information
    to compute more precise results.  We present our algorithm as an
    extension of Serrano's version of 0-CFA and we show that it
    respects types.  We also discuss applications of the analysis with
    examples of optimizations enabled by the analysis that would not
    be possible normal CFA.
